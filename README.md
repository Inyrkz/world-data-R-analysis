# world-data-R-analysis

In this project, I used R to analyze the world dataset. I was able to get answers to the questions below. I also applied some statistical methods to get the 95% confidence interval.

1. How may countries are OECD members?
2. Which countries are non-democratic?
3. Which countries have the a per capita GDP higher than $40,000?
4. How does a country's regime (autocratic or democratic) affect their per capta GDP?
